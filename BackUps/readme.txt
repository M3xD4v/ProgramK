If you want to return your original profile to a backup you need to rename the profile file

A backup will look like this
d8bbc58674605e0c015bee01_2022-11-04_4-58-25_PM.json
d8bbc58674605e0c015bee01 - the id of the profile
2022-11-04 - the date when the backup was made
4-58-25_PM - the time when the backup was made

To return to a backup you need to remove the date and the time from the file name
so from d8bbc58674605e0c015bee01_2022-11-04_4-58-25_PM.json you must get to d8bbc58674605e0c015bee01.json
After that you put the file in user/profiles/  you might need to override the file that is in there if you didnt delete it
